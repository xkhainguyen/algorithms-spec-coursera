## Course 1. Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms

### Programming Assignment #2

1. This file contains all of the 100,000 integers between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive) in some order, with no integer repeated.

 Your task is to compute the number of inversions in the file given, where the _i<sup>th</sup>_ row of the file indicates the _i<sup>th</sup>_ entry of an array.

 Because of the large size of this array, you should implement the fast divide-and-conquer algorithm covered in the video lectures.
