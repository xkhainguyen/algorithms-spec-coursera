# Course 2. Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures

## Programming assignment #4

### 1

The goal of this problem is to implement a variant of the 2-SUM algorithm covered in this week's lectures.

 The file contains _n_ integers (_n â‰¤ 1 million_), both positive and negative (there might be some repetitions!).This is your array of integers, with the _i<sup>th</sup>_ row of the file specifying the _i<sup>th</sup>_ entry of the array.

 Your task is to compute the number of target values _t_ in the interval \[-10000,10000\] (inclusive) such that there are distinct numbers _x_,_y_ in the input file that satisfy _x + y = t_. (NOTE: ensuring distinctness requires a one-line addition to the algorithm from lecture.)

 Write your numeric answer (an integer between 0 and 20001) in the space provided.

 OPTIONAL CHALLENGE: If this problem is too easy for you, try implementing your own hash table for it. For example, you could compare performance under the chaining and open addressing approaches to resolving collisions.
